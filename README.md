# Weather-Forecast
It forcast weather on all the active cities around the world using Open weather API's
This API just gets the data from Open Weather endpoint and deliver the required parameters for the City Weather API.
Using this API we can accurately find out the temperature related changes occuring in the particular city. For now I have only added temperature, Pressure and Humidity. But as per the requirement of this Project various other fields

Here is the sample response I am delivering for a city

{
"temp": 305.03,
"feelsLike": 309.37,
"tempMin": 305.03,
"tempMax": 305.03,
"pressure": 1010,
"humidity": 58,
"description": "scattered clouds",
"icon": "03d",
"cityName": "Coimbatore"
}
